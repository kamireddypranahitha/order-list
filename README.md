## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Menu Categories:** The content is neatly organized into three main categories: **Main Course**, **Desserts**, and **Today Special Menu**.
* **Ordered Lists:** Each menu category uses an ordered list (`<ol>`) to number the items.
* **Internal CSS:** Styling is defined within the `<style>` block in the `<head>`:
    * The main **`<h1>`** title has a black background, is centered, and uses white text.
    * The category headings **`<h2>`** use the Verdana font family and are colored light yellow.
* **Background Color:** The entire page body has a **dark red** background (`bgcolor="darkred"`).
* **Text Styling:** The main course list uses the deprecated **`<font>`** tag to color the text light yellow.
